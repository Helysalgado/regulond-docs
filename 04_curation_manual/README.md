# üìë Curation Manual for Transcriptional Regulation and High-Throughput Data

Welcome to the **Curation Manual** of RegulonDB.

This section documents the curation workflows, standards, evidence classification, and tools used by the RegulonDB team to annotate transcriptional regulatory elements and integrate high-throughput datasets.  
It is designed for curators, scientists, and contributors who participate in the rigorous process of maintaining the quality and integrity of RegulonDB.



## üìö Contents

- **[General Curation Workflow](curation_workflow.md):** Overview of the standard annotation process.
- **[Classical (Literature-Based) Curation](classical_curation.md):** How data is extracted and curated from scientific publications.
- **[High-Throughput Data Curation](ht_data_curation.md):** Handling ChIP-seq, RNA-seq, TSS-seq, and other large-scale datasets.
- **[Curation Tools (Lisen & Curate, EcoCyc)](curation_tools.md):** Platforms and methodologies for assisted curation.
- **[Evidence Classification Guide](evidence_classification.md):** How evidence types are assigned to curated data.
- **[Using MCO for Curation](mco_usage_curation.md):** Application of the Microbial Condition Ontology to annotate experimental conditions.
- **[Quality Control in Curation](quality_control.md):** Standards, validation, and update procedures.
- **[Glossary](glossary.md):** Key definitions for curation terminology.
- **[Appendices](appendices.md):** Templates, forms, and real examples of curated entries.



## üéØ Purpose

The purpose of this manual is to:
- Maintain consistency and high standards across all curated entries.
- Train new curators and contributors in RegulonDB annotation protocols.
- Document the methodologies used for both classical and high-throughput data integration.
- Ensure reproducibility, traceability, and interoperability of curated data under FAIR principles.



## üõ†Ô∏è Requirements

- Background knowledge in molecular biology, particularly transcriptional regulation.
- Familiarity with experimental techniques such as EMSA, footprinting, RNA-seq, and ChIP-seq.
- Understanding of evidence assessment and ontology usage (optional but recommended).
